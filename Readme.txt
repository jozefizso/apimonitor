Product Info
============

API Monitor is a software that monitors and displays API calls made by
applications and services. Its a powerful tool for seeing how applications
and services work or for tracking down problems that you have in your own
applications.

This is the Portable Edition of API Monitor that runs without requiring installation.

   services that are running under accounts that don't have permissions to
   read this directory.
2. Delete gdiplus.dll if running on any OS other than Windows 2000
3. Run apimonitor-x86.exe for monitoring 32-bit applications on a 32-bit
   or 64-bit OS.
