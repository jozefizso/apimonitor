        <!-- I'm not sure what the internal format of HSTRING is, but after some analysis, the following format
        appears to work correctly; at least for displaying the length and contents of the HSTRING. Not sure what
        the other fields are yet. Will analyze another day.
        
        Also, HSTRING_HEADER is defined as a union with a size of 24 bytes on 64-bit and 20 bytes on 32-bit.
        Our format below also has the same size, so there is a good chance that it is correct.
        
        I also tested the API WindowsCreateStringReference and the value returned in the third parameter, which
        is HSTRING_HEADER was decoded correctly from this structure. When WindowsCreateStringReference returns,
        "HSTRING* string" is a pointer to a pointer to "HSTRING_HEADER* hstringHeader", which means that HSTRING
        is a pointer to HSTRING_HEADER, which is what we have defined it to.
        
        Unknown1 appears to be a flag with one or more of the following values
            0x00000000
            0x00000001 - this might be used to indicate if the buffer is allocated internally, or if it's a caller buffer
            0x00000010
            
        The values in Unknown2 and Unknown3 don't appear to be valid. For example, WindowsCreateStringReference sets their
        values to 0xcccccccc.
